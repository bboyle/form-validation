## Traversal

* find a `label` for a form field
* find a `group` containing a form field

## Attributes

* find the current `validationMessage` for a form field

## UI

* `.active` indicates user last interacted with this question or group
* display list of validation alerts in a box `.status`

## Validation
* validate html5 `@required`
* validate html5 `@type=email`

## TODO

### Build
* html5 validation for test pages
* automated execution of unit tests
* acceptance tests (currently only a placeholder)
* dependency management (local jquery copies)
* test against different versions of jquery
* package js files (combine and minify)
